This is a basic game of tic tac toe written in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation.
The purpose of this project was to improve my understanding of WPF application programming as well as to learn to implement some basic game AI.
I initially began with a randomized AI (the AI opponent would place a nought in a random square) then attempted to implement a Minmax algorithm for the AI opponent to solve the board.
The application is playable, but I failed in my first attempt at a Minmax algorithm (the AI opponent will often make non-optimal moves).
TODO:
Fix the minmax algorithm: I will probably have to look at a few other examples of the algorithm to see if I can get it right.
Neaten up the code: this application is clearly not written to the principles of object oriented design, the result of a lack of understanding of WPF on my part.
